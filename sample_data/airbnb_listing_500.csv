I grew up between the Mountains of Colorado, in Vail and Aspen, and a large cattle ranch in Northwest Montana.  After a year of school at Prescott College in Arizona and several more shooting ski films in Colorado, I moved to North Hollywood where I lasted about 6 months before fleeing to Half Moon Bay.  I eventually made it back to Hollywood because of ""The Business"" and for about 5 years lived on my sailboat.  Throughout this time I was traveling the world shooting films and first kayak descents of rivers and ski descents of mountains.  About 10 years ago I met my sweetheart at the Premier of an IMAX Film called ""Mystery of the Nile"" we shot while making the first ""Source to Sea"" descent of the Nile.  After a couple of years living in the Marina we decided to settle in Topanga with our young family.  As luck would have it, we found a magical piece of property, with direct access to over 100 miles of hiking/mountain biking trails through Topanga State Park and adjacent wild areas, while being only 22 miles direct from downtown Los Angeles.  Now I am able to work closer to home and family.  Airbnb along with some beautiful property with stunning views is helping fulfill that dream....

I usually am renting the downstairs unit which consists of a bedroom with a Queen size bed and walk in closet and very spacious bathroom with shower that has features for handicapped usage.. The living room is essentially a huge deck the size of a huge living room you can enjoy for yoga and working on outdoor furniture and chaise lounges.I also have my own private hiking trail behind my property and am very close to all the  cool eating and coffee shops Echo Park has to offer. I am 7 minutes to Echo Park lake and Silverlake reservoir which are both great for walking with your partner or pet if you bring either or both. I'm 3 minutes form Elysian Park which is attached to Dodger Stadium and is an incredible hiking and wildlife refuge. From the deck you have a spectacular view of the LA basin.You can see some of the most iconic sights of Los Angeles without leaving your bed.For example a beautiful view of Griffith Park ,Griffith Observatory, The Hollywood sign, Pacific Design Center,you can even see the Getty Center and Century City looking west. If you look the other direction you have all Glendale and Burbank and the snow covered mountains in winter. There is also quite a nice garden work in progress. You have your own private entrance and every amenity , cleaning and disinfecting products one would need. I tend to stock Kiehls and Aesop products. Also has nice small refrigerator and microwave.Flat screen TV wifi and every cable channel.  In other words I think you will love staying here.During these times,things have changed. I have never been one to have to give so many details. The place was always booked before the pandemic and I feel a need to reassure people that my place is safe and secure.With your own private entrance and (Website hidden by Airbnb) are free to use the kitchen upstairs which is a shared space or just shop for your own foods. There is no stove downstairs but their is a new microwave oven.Works great. Also hot watter kettle and coffee maker for your use.  I hope this helps somewhat in making your decisions to stay. Oh! and recently repainted and redid the whole deck!! There is also a fantastic grill outside for outdoor cooking.

I have properties in NYC and LA because of work in the music industry and this is still relatively early stages of my passion project. I got a couple of incredibly historic buildings across the street from my Hollywood house and converted the lot into stunning vacation homes. It started out with needing a guest house for friends who are touring musicians, actors and producers. Just search World Artists Living Hollywood if you’re interested in seeing more pictures and reviews. Our accommodations are designed to be like 'greenrooms from heaven'! Prior to working in music, I studied hotel management in college back home in Ireland. I began busking with friends in college days and one thing lead to another, so I had to shelve the tourism career for a while and hit the road touring.

I spent years living out of sleeper tour busses, airports, hotels, performing shows at huge venues, TV shows, etc. Days off in nice accommodations were a luxury for the band and crew. I definitely can relate to why former entertainment industry pros endorse and try to nail the perfect travel brand in retirement ;-)

You’re GUARANTEED NOT to find any silly $10 bottles of bedside water, broken appliances, and all that.. If you're looking for CLEAN, hassle free, place to call home for a few weeks - any of the World Artists Living properties are perfect! The majority of our guests now are traveling professionals. My aim is to provide 5 star hotel quality combined with the relaxed vibe of just being at your home (away from home). I work from my Hollywood house now and often invite guests over for drinks on my rooftop garden which is across the street from the rentals. Our housekeeper Natalia and her husband sometimes host grills on the rooftop for guests too. My parents ran a guesthouse when I was growing up in Ireland, long before AirBnB and their genuine hospitality is something that I aim to achieve with World Artists Living. Most guests have more interaction with Natalia than me as she's around the properties daily. We don't operate like a traditional hotel or run of the mill AirBnB - after check in you’ll see that you’ll be extremely comfortable and we run our properties like guest houses SHOULD BE RUN. 

If you’ve stumbled across this searching Hollywood’s Suite, then that’s the unit across the street next to my home house. Guests staying at Hollywood’s Suite are welcome to use the GYM at World Artists Living complimentary.

Thank you for visiting my host profile!
I was born and raised in the beautiful country of Morocco, from where I went to Paris to complete dental school. I finally settled in the sun-soaked City of Angels, where my husband lives. 

In the meantime, I gave up on being a dentist to pursue my passion for event planning. Now I coordinate high-end weddings and events while loving every minute of it. 

Hosting people is an activity I really enjoy, so turning our guesthouse into a short-vacation rental listing came like an easy choice. Through this endeavor, I aim to provide the best possible experience to all visitors through excellent service and quality local recommendations!. There is nothing more reassuring and calming than finding a place that feels like a second home on your travels.

Feel free to book or message me first; I am friendly, outgoing, and happy to answer any specific questions in advance.

I am a well-traveled guest who knows what a host should do to create a comfortable experience. My goal is to fulfill these requirements for every guest.

Experience Beverly Hills with me!  

Hope to host you soon!
